## :computer: Make changes locally 
1. Fork the repository.
- Using GitHub Desktop:
  - [Getting started with GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop) will guide you through setting up Desktop.
  - Once Desktop is set up, you can use it to [fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop)!

- Using the command line:
  - [Fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository) so that you can make your changes without affecting the original project until you're ready to merge them.

2. Install or update Node.js.

3. Create a working branch and start with your changes!

## :gear: Commit your update

1. Stage your changes with the command  `git add`.
2. Then, commit your changes with `git commit -m 'message'`.

## :new: Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.
